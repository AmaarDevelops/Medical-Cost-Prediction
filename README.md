üìä Medical Cost Prediction

Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to predict individual medical costs based on key health and demographic features. Leveraging a supervised learning approach, it provides a valuable tool for stakeholders in the healthcare and insurance industries to inform strategic planning, risk assessment, and personalized premium calculations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Skills
This project demonstrates proficiency in the following technologies and methodologies:

Languages: Python

Core Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Key Algorithms: Regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features (One-Hot Encoding).

Feature Engineering: Transforming and creating relevant features from the raw data.

Model Training & Evaluation: Splitting data, training models, and assessing performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

üìà Methodology & Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and detect anomalies.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The dataset was prepared for model training by converting categorical variables (like sex and smoker) into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can interpret.

Model Selection & Training: Multiple regression models were trained and compared to determine the best fit for the dataset. The Random Forest Regressor proved to be particularly effective due to its ability to handle complex feature interactions.

Model Evaluation: The final model was rigorously evaluated on unseen data to ensure its predictive accuracy and generalization performance.


üéØ Key Achievements

Successfully built and validated a robust regression model to predict medical costs with high accuracy.

Demonstrated an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from raw data to a final, evaluable model.

Provided clear visualizations to communicate key insights and model performance to a non-technical audience.
